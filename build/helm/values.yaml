# ExtraEnvVars is a convenience mechanism to specify additional "unspecified/undocumented"
# environment variables which can be passed in to the main container of the pod.
# This is to be used sparingly and exceptionally -- in general the expectation would
# be that such values migrate to specific documented values in this file.
#
# See the Readme.md for the full list of environment variables.
#
# Example :
#    - name: APP_FEATURE_RDS-IAM
#      value: "true"
#    - name: APP_NETWORK_SERVICE_DISCOVERY_AS_LOCALHOST
#      value: "false"
